# Image-Compression-using-K-means
Built an image compression application with k-means algo using sci-kit learn 

•	Applied the (mini-batch)K-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.
•	For interactive controls, used jupyter widgets library to create interactive GUI components. 
• Help us to catagorise the data in a better way.
